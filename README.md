I need to keep track of which rooms have been checked out at a hotel. The hotel does have a couple of programs that keep track of rooms status and other info, like Opera, but I don't know of any method to pull up the checked out rooms in order of checkout time that is intended for this function.
Instead of keeping track of this on paper and sending the housekeepers an unordered list, I'll use this webapp to sort and log checkouts right before sending the housekeepers that info.
