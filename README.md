# room number tracker

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/cozmikdx/pen/PoxNMOZ](https://codepen.io/cozmikdx/pen/PoxNMOZ).

I need to keep track of which rooms have been checked out at a hotel. The hotel does have a couple of programs that keep track of rooms status and other info, like Opera, but I don't know of any method to pull up the checked out rooms in order of checkout time that is intended for this function.
Instead of keeping track of this on paper and sending the housekeepers an unordered list, I'll use this webapp to sort and log checkouts right before sending the housekeepers that info.

Because I used and probably will continue using codepen while making this, since I can work on it at work that way, this repo will contain two directories.

The src directory is what is edited in codepen and the dist directory is for distribution and the html file has all the content codepen normally doesn't display such as the `<head>` block.
